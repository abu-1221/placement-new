### Database Creation Prompt

> "Act as a Database Architect. I have extracted structured data from the Jamal Mohamed College (JMC) website, including departments (25+), program categories (Aided/Self-Finance), administration desks, and facilities (CDC, Library, Placement).
>
> 1. **Schema Design:** Propose a relational database schema (SQL) with tables for `Departments`, `Programmes`, `Categories`, `Administration`, and `Facilities`.
> 2. **Persistence:** Suggest a strategy for persistent storage (e.g., using a hosted PostgreSQL or a local SQLite database matching my current setup).
> 3. **AI Integration:** Describe how to index this data so that an AI assistant can efficiently retrieve specific information (e.g., 'What are the Self Finance programmes for women?') using SQL queries or a vector-based search if needed.
> 4. **Implementation:** Provide the `CREATE TABLE` scripts and sample `INSERT` statements for the key departments and facilities found in the extraction."
